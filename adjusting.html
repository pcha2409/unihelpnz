                <p>
                    Feeling lonely at uni is far more common than people admit...especially at the start.
                    Making friends doesn’t happen instantly, and that’s okay.

                <h3>Academic pressure</h3>
                <p>
                    Uni learning is very different from school and struggling does not mean you’re not capable.
                    It usually means you’re adjusting.

                    <li>Use learning advisors and student hubs early, not only when things feel bad</li>
                    <li>Ask questions, even if they feel “basic”</li>

                <h3>Feeling overwhelmed</h3>
                <p>
                    Uni throws a lot at you at once: systems, deadlines, emails, expectations.
                    Feeling overwhelmed doesn’t mean you’re failing.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Break tasks into smaller steps (week by week, not semester-wide)</li>
                    <li>Use planners or digital calendars to externalise your workload</li>
                    <li>Remember: doing less, consistently, is better than burning out</li>

                <h3>Balancing everything</h3>
                <p>
                    Balancing study, work, family, and rest is one of the hardest parts of uni life.
                    There’s no perfect formula.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It’s okay to reduce work hours if possible during heavy study periods</li>
                    <li>Rest is productive and burnout is not</li>
                    <li>Check what flexibility your university offers</li>

                <h3>Doubting myself</h3>
                <p>
                    Many students experience imposter syndrome.... even high-achievers.
                    Feeling unsure doesn’t mean you don’t belong.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Progress at uni is rarely linear</li>
                    <li>Compare yourself to your past self, not others</li>
                    <li>Confidence grows through experience, not perfection</li>
