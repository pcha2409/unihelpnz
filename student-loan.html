    <h2>Student Loans</h2>
    <p class="intro">
        Studylink is a tool through which students can acesss and apply for a student loan.
        However, many people can get confused with the different aspects that are involved
        with the process of applying for a loan, and I wanted to make a tool to help people
        understand the tricky parts. 
        Click on the button/s of information you would like to know more about when applying
        for your student loan:
    </p>

    <div class="dropdown">

        <button class="dropdown-btn">When should I apply?</button>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>
                Some students make the mistake of applying for a student loan when university starts
                which is something that you should not be doing.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Applying early doesn’t lock you into anything. It just protects you from delays
                when rent and textbook costs suddenly come up. StudyLink applications can take weeks to process, 
                and sometimes even longer if you end up having missing documents etc. This is why you need to 
                apply early, so any problems or situations can be sorted out before the semester starts.

    <div class="dropdown">

        <button class="dropdown-btn">Living costs vs course-related costs</button>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>
                These are two different things, and StudyLink treats them differently.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Living costs:</strong> weekly money for rent, food, transport</li>
                <li><strong>Course-related costs:</strong> one-off money for textbooks, laptop, stationery</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                
            </p>
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="dropdown">

        <button class="dropdown-btn">Why is StudyLink asking for more documents?</button>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>
                This is extremely common and does NOT mean your application failed.
            </p>
            <p>
                StudyLink often asks for extra proof even when everything is correct.
                It usually means that there is something missing in your application,
                or the documents you have provided are not clear/what they asked for.

    <div class="dropdown">

        <button class="dropdown-btn">What if payments don’t arrive straight away?</button>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>
                Payments rarely arrive the moment classes start.
                This catches a lot of students off guard.
            </p>
            <p>
                Living costs often don’t arrive in your first week of uni, and that can catch
                 a lot of students off guard, but it’s normal, not a mistake. StudyLink pays 
                 living costs in arrears, which means you study first and get paid for that time 
                 later. Depending on when your application is approved, your first payment may come 
                 in the second week or as a lump sum that covers earlier weeks. This is why it’s important 
                 to plan ahead if you can: having a small buffer, talking to your uni’s student hub, 
                 or arranging temporary support can ease stress in those first weeks. If payments feel 
                 delayed, it doesn’t mean something is wrong, it usually means your application is 
                 still processing, and support is available if you need help bridging the gap.

        <button class="dropdown-btn">What is RealMe?</button>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>
                A RealMe account is something that you need to login to StudyLink, even as 
                a first time student.
            </p>
            <p>
                RealMe is a secure online login system used in New Zealand that lets you prove 
                who you are when accessing government services, including StudyLink. Instead of 
                creating separate usernames and passwords for each service, RealMe acts as one 
                trusted digital identity that confirms it is really you. When you use RealMe, 
                it protects your personal information and allows services like StudyLink to safely 
                check your details, apply for student loans or allowances, and manage your account 
                online without needing to visit an office in person.

        <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>
                One of the reasons why I made this website was not only to help students with navigating 
                university, but also the other aspects and challenges that come with it. A problem that 
                students often have when starting university is that they're in a new environment (thrown into the deep end!), 
                and automatically expected to budget effectively. Not only that, we are expected to have savings
                after all our expenses. Getting financial independence is important for students, especially when they 
                come out of university, so they can have their own savings to go towards investing, emergency funds, healthcare etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                A common mistake students make is trying to budget too far ahead. Thinking in terms of a whole semester can 
                feel overwhelming and unrealistic, especially when income and expenses fluctuate. Weekly budgeting 
                is far more manageable and much closer to how money actually moves as a student.
                A simple weekly budget usually includes rent, groceries, transport, phone costs (like data), 
                and a small buffer for unexpected expenses. That buffer matters more than people think and without 
                it, even small surprises can cause stress. Budgeting isn’t about restricting yourself; it’s 
                about knowing what you can spend without constantly worrying. It's also about gaining independence and not 
                having to rely on others to help you out of a tough situation. This is a great setup for the future, 
                where more things come in like mortgage payments, insurance costs etc.<br>

                Here's a budgeting guide to help you get started:<br>
                <strong>1: Know exactly what money you have coming in</strong><br> 
                Start by writing down all your regular income. This might include StudyLink living costs, 
                a student allowance, wages from a part-time job, or help from family. Use the actual 
                amount that lands in your bank account, not what you hope to earn. This gives you a 
                realistic starting point and prevents over-budgeting.<br>

                <strong>Step 2: List your fixed weekly costs first</strong><br>
                Fixed costs are expenses that usually don’t change week to week. 
                Rent is the biggest one, followed by things like power, internet, 
                phone bills, and transport passes. Add these up first, because this 
                money is already “spoken for.” What’s left after this is what you can 
                actually budget with.<br>

                <strong>3: Estimate your flexible spending honestly</strong><br>
                Flexible costs include groceries, eating out, social spending, and 
                personal items. Instead of guessing, look at your bank statements from the last 
                few weeks to see what you actually spend. Many students underestimate this part, 
                which is why budgets fall apart, and honesty here matters more than perfection.<br>

                <strong>Step 4: Create a small buffer (this is important)</strong><br>
                Always leave a small amount unassigned each week if you can. This buffer covers 
                unexpected costs like prescriptions, flat expenses, or last-minute transport. 
                Even $20–$30 can reduce stress significantly. A budget without a buffer is fragile.<br>

                <strong>Step 5: Budget weekly, not monthly or semester-long</strong><br>
                Weekly budgeting works best for students because most income and expenses 
                happen weekly. It’s easier to adjust, easier to track, and less overwhelming. 
                At the end of each week, do a quick check-in: did you overspend anywhere? 
                Do you need to adjust next week?<br>

                <strong>Step 6: Track spending without judging yourself</strong><br>
                Tracking isn’t about guilt, it’s about awareness. Whether you use 
                an app, a spreadsheet, or just notes on your phone, write down what 
                you spend for a couple of weeks. Patterns will show up naturally, 
                and that’s how budgeting starts to feel easier.

                <strong>Step 7: Adjust as your situation changes</strong><br>
                Your budget will change during the year with workloads increase, 
                hours change, rent changes, or StudyLink payments shift. That’s 
                normal. A good budget is flexible. If something stops working, 
                it doesn’t mean you failed; it means it’s time to update it.<br>

                <strong>Step 8: Ask for help early if money feels tight</strong><br>
                If you’re constantly stressed about money, talk to someone sooner rather than later. 
                Student hubs, and budgeting services exist to help you before things reach crisis 
                point. Using support is part of being financially responsible, not a sign of failure.<br>
